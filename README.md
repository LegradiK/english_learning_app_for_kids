# 🧠 Word Wizard – Phonics Quiz App

A fun, interactive phonics and spelling quiz for primary school children (Reception – Year 2). Built with Flask and vanilla JavaScript.

Text-to-speech is powered by Puter AI, delivering natural-sounding British English voices (Amy & Brian). If Puter is unavailable, the app falls back to the browser's built-in speech synthesis — which works but is noticeably lower quality.

Children listen to a spoken word or sentence, type their answer, and get instant visual feedback — with letter-by-letter colour coding showing exactly what they got right or wrong. The app covers 4 stages of increasing difficulty, from simple CVC words up to full sentence comprehension, and tracks progress through each word set with a progress bar and dot indicators.

## 🎮 How It Works

The app has 4 stages, each targeting a different phonics skill:

**Stage 1 & 2 – Hear & Spell**
- A word is read aloud
- The child types what they hear
- On reveal, their answer is compared letter-by-letter with colour coding

**Stage 3 – Sight Words**
- Same format as Stage 1/2 but uses high-frequency word lists (Top 100 / 200 / 300)

**Stage 4 – Sentence Fill**
- A full sentence is read aloud
- The child sees the sentence with a missing word (`___`)
- They type the missing word and check their answer

| Stage 1–2–4 | Stage 3 |
|-------------|---------|
| Reception | Top 100 |
| Year 1 | Top 200 |
| Year 2 | Top 300 |
| All |

## 🔊 Text-to-Speech

The app uses two TTS methods, in order of preference:

1. **Puter AI** (`puter.ai.txt2speech`) – neural British English voices (Amy / Brian)
2. **Browser SpeechSynthesis** – fallback if Puter is unavailable

Voice can be switched between female (Amy) and male (Brian) using the voice toggle in the UI.
